# comments: comments always start with "#"
# everything that follows a "#" is a comment and the computer
# does not read it as code.
''' Longer comments that span multiple lines


you can use a triple quotation

like this. Anything between triple quoatations is a comment.

#Variables

elephant = 10

# called variable becuase we can change them.
#x = x + 4

pi = "done"
#for printing, we do not need quotation marks around variables
print(elephant)
print(pi)

# when printing variables, we print their VALUE

# Compounds example

myNum = 20
myAn = "Chameleon"

#print(myNum + myAn) does not work

myNum = str(myNum)

print(myNum + myAn)
print(myNum + " " + myAn + "s")

# when we add strings in python, we 'concatenate' them (push them together)

# It works differently for int type variables. Use math operators.

x = 6
y = 2

#we can see the data type with the function "type()"


print(type(x + y)) #if you add two integers you always get an integer
print(type(x*y)) #if you multiply two integers you always get an integer
print(type(x/y)) #if you divide two integers you DO NOT always get an int
