#Class Notes 10/19
# Mr. Considine

# User input! Really important if you want your program to do anything
# interactive or that solves an issue or question.

# input has space for a user prompt.
# the output (or what it is = to) is your variable name for the input

'''data = input("Give me a number!")
data = int(data)

result = 5 * data

print(result)'''

#inputs are always given the string data type.

#Loops! Loops in python are very similar to the functionality
# of loops (repeats) in scratch

#Definite loops are loops that repeat a certain number of times.

for i in range(10):
    print(i)

# "i" is an iterator. It keeps track of which repetition it is currently on
# iterators (and many other things) start with 0.

#iterators can help you move through a list.
# ["cat", "dog", "parrot", "fish", "unicorn"]
# [position 0, position 1, position 2, position 3, position 4] (indexes)

pets = ["cat", "dog", "parrot", "fish", "unicorn", "chameleon"]

for i in range(len(pets)):
    print(pets[i])

# len() is a function you can use for a list to see how many elements are in the list
